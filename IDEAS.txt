MINOR:

-- datagen, data reanalysis, maybe other things
- validate this FEN properly: "r3qrk1/pppb1pbp/3p1np1/3P2B1/2PpP3/2N2PP1/PP1Q3P/R3KB1R w kq - 0 4"
- make optimism work
- HalfKAT?
- extra features in the unused pawn backranks for NNUE
  - opposite coloured bishops
  - locked pawns?
  - bishop pair
  - passed pawns by file?
